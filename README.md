These are full neighbourhood search algorithm of [Alexei Efros + Thomas Leung](https://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Research/Projects/CS/vision/papers/efros-iccv99.pdf) and [Li-Yi Wei + Marc Levoy](https://graphics.stanford.edu/papers/texture-synthesis-sig00/texture.pdf) and k-coherent neighbourhood search of [Michael Ashikhmin](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall10/cos526/papers/ashikhmin01a.pdf) and [Xin Tong + Jingdan Zhangz + Ligang Liu + Xi Wangz + Baining Guo + Heung-Yeung Shum](http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/65191/btfsynthesis.pdf) with small modifications.

K-coherent search takes computational burden from the synthesis to the analysis part and therefore is better suited for synthesizing large textures. Full search produces better results from non-texture image samples and from some texture samples too.
